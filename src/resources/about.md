This site is an educational resource for those involved in the hobby of lockpicking and lock manipulation.

It's easy to subscribe to so many channels that you end up missing videos from a lot of them. We'd like this site to be an alternative to that, where you can discover channels and get a feed of new videos from across the community.

#### :30

YouTube only counts views if you watch more than 30 seconds of a video.
Help out creators by watching for a little while. You'll see a little indicator above the video player that turns green when you hit the 30-second mark. **Thanks!**

#### I want in! (or out)

lockpicking.tv is open to any channel that is primarily & mostly about locks and locksport. We are not currently featuring channels that are commercial in nature. To submit your channel -- or to have your channel and/or videos removed from the site -- please drop us a line us at [contact@lockpicking.tv](mailto:contact@lockpicking.tv)

#### Special Thanks

lockpicking.tv was built on concept and refinement from Adam Harris, Lady Locks, LockChuck, and mgsecure. 

#### Stay safe, stay legal

Please note that it is illegal in many areas for non-professional to pick locks that are actively securing something.
Respect the cardinal rules of locksport: never pick a lock in use, never pick a lock you don't own.

### Enjoy!
