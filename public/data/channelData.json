        "description": "Welcome to my locksport channel! I focus primarily on single pin picking (SPP) locks of various types, but from time to time may have videos on other subjects. These videos are geared towards individuals in the lockpicking community but may be of interest to those who generally want to understand locks better. I try to start each picking video with an overview of the lock I'm working on and it's security features before picking. Warning - sometimes the picking sections can run long, with varying levels of commentary depending on how much focus I need. I occasionally do more informational videos as well. If you'd like to learn more about lockpicking, check the links below. \n\nAll the locks seen in these videos are owned by me or on loan and none are in use. I haven't received compensation from any company whose products may be shown or mentioned in a video. I am a hobbyist and not a professional locksmith, so take any information presented here as my opinion only.\n\n",
